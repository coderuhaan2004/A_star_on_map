# A_star_on_map
I have implemented A* algorithm on geospatial data. This implementation does not give practical shortest path as there are lot of constraints on-road which are not considered. Many such consideration can be made to make it more accurate.

1. Make sure the all the mentioned python libraries are installed.
2. Run the '''main.py''' or '''main_with_example.py''' file on IDE.
